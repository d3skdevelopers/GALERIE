1. A description of the copyrighted work you claim has been infringed
2. A description of the material you claim is infringing, with enough detail for us to locate it

We will respond to valid takedown notices within a reasonable time. Repeat infringers will have their accounts terminated.

**Counter-notification:** If you believe your content was removed in error, you may send a counter-notification to [dmca@galerie.art]. Counter-notifications must include your contact information, identification of the removed content, a statement under penalty of perjury that removal was a mistake or misidentification, and consent to jurisdiction of your local federal district court.

## 8. PIGMENT Integration

If you choose to evolve your artwork using PIGMENT, your work's genome (a polygon-based mathematical representation of your image) is shared with PIGMENT's servers for processing. This is optional and only occurs when you explicitly click "Evolve."

PIGMENT may use the anonymized outputs of evolution processes (operator statistics, fitness scores) to improve their AI. Your personal identity, email address, and original artwork are not shared with PIGMENT beyond what is necessary to process the evolution request. See our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md) for more detail.
