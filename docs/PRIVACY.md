## 3. Data Storage and Infrastructure

Your data is stored using:

- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL database + file storage) — hosted on AWS. Data stored in [INSERT REGION]. Supabase's privacy policy: https://supabase.com/privacy
- **Vercel** — backend API hosting. Vercel's privacy policy: https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy

We do not sell your personal data. We do not share your data with advertisers or data brokers.

---

## 4. PIGMENT Data Sharing

When you choose to evolve your artwork using PIGMENT:

**What we share with PIGMENT:**
- Your artwork's genome (a polygon-based mathematical representation of your image — not the original file)
- Your GALERIE username handle (e.g. `@goya`) as metadata on training records
- Evolution statistics (operator used, success/failure, fitness score, generation number)

**What we do NOT share with PIGMENT:**
- Your email address
- Your IP address
- Your original HTML/image file
- Any other personal information

PIGMENT uses aggregated, anonymized training data to improve their AI model. Your identity is not linked to individual training records in PIGMENT's systems.

If you delete your artwork, we will make reasonable efforts to request deletion of associated PIGMENT data, though PIGMENT's training data (which is aggregated) may not be retroactively removable.

## 5. Cookies and Session Storage

We use **browser session storage** to maintain your authentication state. We do not use third-party tracking cookies. We do not use advertising cookies.

---

## 6. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have the following rights:

**Access** — Request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.

**Deletion** — Request that we delete your account and associated personal data. Note that your uploaded artworks may be retained in anonymized form if they have been approved to the gallery and others have written about them, to preserve the integrity of those records.

**Correction** — Update your profile information at any time in your account settings.

**Portability** — Request your data in a machine-readable format.

**Objection** — Object to certain processing of your data.

To exercise any of these rights, email us at [privacy@galerie.art]. We will respond within 30 days (or the timeframe required by applicable law).
