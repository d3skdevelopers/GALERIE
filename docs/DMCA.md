## Filing a Takedown Notice

If you believe content on GALERIE infringes your copyright, send a written notice to our designated agent that includes **all** of the following:

1. **Identification of the copyrighted work** — Describe the work you claim has been infringed. If multiple works are covered by a single notice, provide a representative list.

2. **Identification of the infringing material** — Describe the specific content you claim is infringing with enough detail for us to locate it. Include the URL(s) if possible.

3. **Your contact information** — Your full name, mailing address, telephone number, and email address.

4. **Good-faith statement** — A statement that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

5. **Accuracy statement** — A statement, made under penalty of perjury, that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

6. **Signature** — Your physical or electronic signature.

**Important:** Submitting a false DMCA notice is a serious legal matter. You may be liable for damages (including costs and attorney fees) under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f) if you knowingly misrepresent that material is infringing.

## Our Response

Upon receipt of a valid takedown notice, we will:

1. Remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing content promptly
2. Notify the user who uploaded the content
3. Provide the user with a copy of the notice (with your personal contact information redacted if legally permissible)

---

## Counter-Notification

If content you uploaded was removed due to a DMCA notice and you believe the removal was a mistake or misidentification, you may file a counter-notification.

Send your counter-notification to our designated agent with:

1. **Identification of the removed material** — Describe the content that was removed and the URL where it appeared before removal.

2. **Statement under penalty of perjury** — A statement that you have a good-faith belief the material was removed as a result of mistake or misidentification.

3. **Your contact information** — Your name, address, telephone number, and email address.

4. **Consent to jurisdiction** — A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which you reside (or, if outside the US, any judicial district in which GALERIE may be found), and that you will accept service of process from the person who filed the original notice.

5. **Signature** — Your physical or electronic signature.

**After receiving a valid counter-notification**, we will:
- Forward it to the original complainant
- Restore the removed content within 10–14 business days unless the complainant notifies us they have filed a court action seeking an injunction

## Repeat Infringer Policy

GALERIE will terminate, in appropriate circumstances, the accounts of users who are determined to be repeat infringers. A "repeat infringer" is a user who has been the subject of more than two valid DMCA takedown notices within a 12-month period.

We reserve the right to make this determination at our discretion, taking into account the circumstances of each case.

## Good Faith Actions
